// This is a singleton that will spawn new sounds through function calls. Ambient sounds that always are present should simply be attached to their respective gameobjects.
// Instructions:
// Add a reference to the game object prefab that contains the audio you want to play: public GameObject SoundObjectVariableNameHere;
// Which obviously means you need an audio prefab. You can create one by dragging an audio file into the Hierarchy, dragging the resulting object into the audio/prefabs folder and deleting the object in the hierarchy
// Call the function you want to use: ArsonisticSoundManager.instance.PlayAudio(SoundObjectVariableNameHere, false, this.gameObject);
// Where "SoundObjectVariableNameHere" is a variable name of your choice (just needs to match variable declaration), "false" is whether the sound will follow the object emitting the sound
// Set to true in case of for example music playing from a car-radio in the world. Also set it to true if using 2D sounds, to keep the hierarchy clear.
// and "this.gameObject" SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED. It's a reference to the game object containing the script; the sound manager needs to know what object is creating the sound to be able to localize it.
